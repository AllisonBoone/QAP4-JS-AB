# QAP4-JS-AB

This is a JavaScript program that displays a motel customers information to the console and leaves a short paragrah about them.

First I created a motelCustomer object which lists attributes about the customer, using an array for the room prefrences and a sub-object for the mailing address and checkout date. 
After that, creating functions to calculate the age of the customer by take their birsthdate and subtracting it from current day. 
Then creating a function to determine the duration of the customers stay by subtracting the checkout date from the checkin date. 
finally writing a function that laid out all the customer information is an easily read format and then using that to write a small paragraph about the customer and displaying it on the console.
